= How To: Change redirect destination

You can change the redirect destination for any Rodauth action by overriding
the corresponding <tt>*_redirect</tt> method:

  plugin :rodauth do
    # ...
    # redirect to "/dashboard" after login
    login_redirect "/dashboard"
    # redirect to wherever login redirects to after creating account
    create_account_redirect { login_redirect }
    # redirect to login page after password reset
    reset_password_redirect { login_path }
  end
