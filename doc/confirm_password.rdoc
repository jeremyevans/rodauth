= Documentation for Confirm Password Feature

The confirm password feature allows you to redirect users to a page to
confirm their password.  It's used by the remember feature, but can also
by your application if you want to confirm passwords.

When confirming passwords, if authenticated via autologin, a remember token,
or an email_auth token, switches the authentication type from that login
method to password.
