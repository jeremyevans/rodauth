= New Features

* A json feature has been extracted from the existing jwt feature.
  This feature allows for the same JSON API previously supported
  by the JWT feature, but stores the session information in the
  Rack session instead of in a separate JWT.  This makes it
  significantly easier to have certain pages use the JSON API,
  and other pages the HTML forms.

= Other Improvements

* If the remember cookie is created in an SSL request, the Secure
  flag is added by default, so the cookie will not be transmitted
  in non-SSL requests.

= Backwards Compatibility

* Rodauth configurations that use the remember feature and support
  requests over both http and https and want to have the remember
  cookie transmitted over both should now include :secure=>false in
  remember_cookie_options.
