= Documentation for Reset Password Feature

The reset password feature implements password resets.  If the user enters
an invalid password, they will be displayed a form where they can request
a password reset.  Submitting that form will send an email containing a
link, and that link will taken them to a password reset form. Depends on
the login feature.
