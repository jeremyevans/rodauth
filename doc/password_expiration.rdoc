= Documentation for Password Expiration Feature

The password expiration feature requires that users change their
password on login if it has expired (default: every 90 days). You can
force password expiration checks for all logged in users by adding
the following code to your route block:

   rodauth.require_current_password

Additionally, you can set a minimum amount of time after a password
is changed until it can be changed again.  By default this is not
enabled, but it can be enabled by setting +allow_password_change_after+
to a positive number of seconds.

It is not recommended to use this feature unless you have a policy that
requires it, as password expiration in general results in users chosing
weaker passwords.  When asked to change their password, many users choose
a password that is based on their previous password, so forcing password
expiration is in general a net loss from a security perspective.
