= Documentation for Update Password Hash Feature

The update password hash feature updates the hash for the password whenever
the hash cost changes.  For example, if you have a cost of 8, and later
increase the cost to 10, anytime the user authenticates correctly with
their password, their password hash will change from one that uses a cost
of 8 to one that uses a cost of 10.
