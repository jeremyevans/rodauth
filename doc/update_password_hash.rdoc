= Documentation for Update Password Hash Feature

The update password hash feature updates the hash for the password whenever
the hash cost changes or hashing algorithm.  For example, if you use bcrypt and have a cost of 8, and later
increase the cost to 10, anytime the user authenticates correctly with
their password, their password hash will change from one that uses a cost
of 8 to one that uses a cost of 10. Also you can migrate users passwords from bcrypt to argon2 and vice versa or change cost for argon2.
