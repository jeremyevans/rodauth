= How To: Translate with I18n gem

Rodauth allows transforming user-facing text configuration such as flash
messages, validation errors, labels etc. via the +translate+ configuration
method. This method receives a name of a configuration along with its default
value, and is expected to return the result text.

You can use this to perform translations using the
{I18n gem}[https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n]:

  plugin :rodauth do
    # ...
    translate do |key, default|
      I18n.translate("rodauth.#{key}") || default
    end
  end

Your translation file may then look something like this:

  en:
    rodauth:
      login_notice_flash: "You have been signed in"
      require_login_error_flash: "Login is required for accessing this page"
      no_matching_login_message: "user with this email address doesn't exist"
      reset_password_email_subject: "Password Reset Instructions"
      # ...
