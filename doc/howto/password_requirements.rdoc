= How To: Customize password requirements

By default, Rodauth requires passwords to have at least 6 characters. You can
increase the minimum length:

  plugin :rodauth
    # ...
    # require passwords to have at least 8 characters
    password_minimum_length 8
  end

You can also additional complexity checks on passwords via the {password
complexity}[rdoc-ref:doc/password_complexity.rdoc] feature.
