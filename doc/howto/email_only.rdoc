= How To: Allow only email authentication

When using the email authentication feature, you can avoid other authentication
mechanisms entirely as follows:

  plugin :rodauth do
    enable :login, :email_auth, :create_account, :verify_account

    create_account_set_password? false
    verify_account_set_password? false
    force_email_auth? true
  end

With this configuration, users won't be required to enter a password on
registration, and on login the email auth link will automatically be sent after
the email address is entered.
