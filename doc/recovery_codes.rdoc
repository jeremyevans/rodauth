= Documentation for Recovery Codes Feature

The recovery codes feature allows multifactor authentication via single use recovery
codes.  It is usually used as a backup if other multifactor authentication methods are
not available or have been locked out, but can be used by itself.  It allows
users to view authentication recovery codes as well as regenerate recovery codes.

Access to recovery codes is limited to authenticated sessions only, so users should
be recommended to securely store/preserve a subset of these codes prior to any chance
of them being required due to a missing / lost device.
