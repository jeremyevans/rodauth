= Documentation for Login Feature

The login feature implements a login page.  It's the most commonly
used feature.

In addition to the auth methods below, it provides a +login+ method that wraps
+login_session+, running login hooks and redirecting to the configured
location.

  rodauth.account           #=> { id: 123, ... }
  rodauth.login('password') # login the current account
