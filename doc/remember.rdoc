= Documentation for Remember Feature

The remember feature allows for token-based autologin for users. Calling
+rodauth.remember_login+ for an authenticated session will create a token for
the current account and store it in a cookie. You can then add the following
code to your routing block to automatically login users from that token if the
session has expired:

  rodauth.load_memory

By default, the remember feature just supports a form that the user can use
to change their remember settings for the current browser.  They can either
enable remembering for the browser, forget it for the browser, or disable
it completely so that any remembering for other browsers is removed as well.

In some cases, you may want to automatically remember users and not require
users to turn it on manually.  If you want to automatically remember users
on login:

  after_login do
    remember_login
  end

The remember feature records which sessions were autologged in via the
remember cookie. If you have sections where you want to add more security,
you can use the confirm password feature to request password authentication
for sessions autologged in via a remember token:

  rodauth.require_password_authentication

== Auth Value Methods

extend_remember_deadline? :: Whether to extend the remember token deadline when the user is autologged in via remember token.
raw_remember_token_deadline :: A deadline before which to allow a raw remember token to be used. Allows for graceful transition for when +hmac_secret+ is first set.
remember_additional_form_tags :: HTML fragment containing additional form tags to use on the change remember setting form.
remember_button :: The text to use for the change remember settings button.
remember_cookie_key :: The cookie name to use for the remember token.
remember_cookie_options :: Any options to set for the remember cookie. By default, the `:path` cookie option is set to `/` and `:httponly` is set to `true`. Also, `:secure` is set to `true` by default if the current request is an HTTPS request.
remember_deadline_column :: The column name in the +remember_table+ storing the deadline after which the token will be ignored.
remember_deadline_interval :: The amount of time for which to remember accounts, 14 days by default.  Only used if +set_deadline_values?+ is true.
remember_disable_label :: The label for disabling remembering.
remember_disable_param_value :: The parameter value for disabling remembering.
remember_error_flash :: The flash error to show if there is an error changing a remember setting.
remember_forget_label :: The label for turning off remembering.
remember_forget_param_value :: The parameter value for turning off remembering.
remember_id_column :: The id column in the +remember_table+, should be a foreign key referencing the accounts table.

== Auth Methods

add_remember_key :: Add a remember key for the current account to the remember keys table.
after_load_memory :: Run arbitrary code after autologging in an account via a remember token.
after_remember :: Run arbitrary code after changing the remember settings.
before_load_memory :: Run arbitrary code before autologging in an account via a remember token.
before_remember :: Run arbitrary code before changing the remember settings.
before_remember_route :: Run arbitrary code before handling the remember route.
disable_remember_login :: Disable the remember key token, clearing the token from the database so future connections with the token will not be recognized.

get_remember_key :: Retrieve the remember key from the database.
load_memory :: If the remember key cookie is included in the request, and the user is not currently logged in, check the remember keys table and autologin the user if the remember key cookie matches the current remember key for the account.
